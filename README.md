# Day10-Toggle-Mode
Responsive Dark/Light Mode Toggle (Day 10 of #100DaysofWeb)
Overview
This repository showcases my progress on Day 10 of the #100DaysofWeb challenge. The focus for today was on creating a simple yet fully responsive website with a dynamic Dark/Light Mode Toggle. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of client-side interactivity using JavaScript, combined with robust CSS for styling and responsiveness.

The goal was to build a user-friendly feature that enhances accessibility and user preference, applying recent learning in DOM manipulation and event handling.

Features
This project highlights the implementation of the following concepts:

Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Allows users to switch between a light and dark theme for the website with a simple click.
Responsive Design: The layout gracefully adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on both mobile devices and desktops.
JavaScript-driven Styling:
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically selecting and modifying HTML elements to apply theme-specific CSS classes or inline styles.
Event Handling: Attaching click event listeners to dedicated buttons to trigger the theme change functionality.
CSS Styling: Defined distinct visual styles for both the light and dark themes, including background colors, text colors, and component styles.
HTML Structure: Clean and semantic HTML provides the basic framework for the content and the toggle buttons.
